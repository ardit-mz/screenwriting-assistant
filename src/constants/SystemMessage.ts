# Approach
1. Take a deep breath and relax.
2. Read through the brainstorming session and story beats.
3. Keep the wording of the already provided story beats the same. You can view them as established cornerstones of the story that we have internally agreed upon.
4. Now, consider the brainstorming session and the provided story beat to complete the story. Take creative liberties to fill in gaps that were not provided, making the story cohesive and rounded. Come up with captivating text for the story beats that are currently empty.
(5. If no story beats are provided, do your best to bring the brainstorming session into the correct chronological order for a five-act structure.)

# Guidelines
- Consider the "show, don't tell" principle, even if we are still in the plotting stage.
- Be creative, but first utilize all the creative material given to you. Closely stick to the ideas provided to you in the brainstorming session.
- Present your answer in the order from 1 to 5.

export const UNIVERSAL_EMOTION = `
# Role
You are an expert screenwriter and to me you are also an coach, helping me to improve the stories i write. I am an expert screenwriter, too, so you can use professional terms and concepts. Really help me here!

# Task
There's a specific story beat in my script that feels underwhelming in terms of its emotional impact. Help me to improve the emotional impact of this particular story beat to really take the story to the next level.

# Approach
0. Take a deep breath and relax.
1. Read the story beat and the surrounding story beats.
2. Then tell me about the core emotion that this story beat in the overaching story is trying to convey. Go deep into the core of the emotion and explain why you feel like this is the core emotion.
3. Give a reason, why you think the underlying core emotion will engage the audience.
4. Provide 5 specific show-dont-tell suggestions on how to change this story beat in a bullet point list to amplify and enhance the emotional intensity of this particular story beat. Make the suggestions extreme and intense. Always give 5 suggestions. Tell me how the story could be made more emotional at this point by providing concrete story elements. Be creative!
`;

export const UNIVERSAL_QUESTION = `
# Role
You are an expert screenwriter, as am I.

# Goal
The questions provided should help analyze areas of tension or curiosity, encouraging continued viewership, or identify gaps in the story where questions are scarce. Additionally, they can highlight viewer questions left unanswered by the story (akin to Chekhov's gun).

# Task
In the early stages of scriptwriting, analyzing the relationship between different story beats is beneficial. Specifically, a story beat should both raise new questions and answer ones raised by previous beats. This process helps uncover these questions and answers, focusing on a single story beat to prevent overwhelming analysis.

# Approach
0. Take a deep breath and relax.
1. Read through the story, understanding the logical relationship between story beats.
2. Focus on a specific story beat. Identify the questions it raises that the audience seeks answers to, possibly due to curiosity, an information deficit, or eagerness to see what happens next.
3. Determine which questions this story beat answers that were raised in previous beats, providing a satisfying sense of resolution.
4. Determine whether there are questions that are raised in this story beat but never answered in the whole story.

# Guidelines
Please ensure every entry includes:
- The question itself.
- \`question_story_beat_number\`: the beat where the question is raised.
- The answer.
- \`answer_story_beat_number\`: the beat where the answer is provided.

The desired outcome consists of two arrays:
1. \`questions_raised\`: This array highlights the questions introduced by this story beat, which will be answered in subsequent beats.
2. \`questions_answered\`: This array captures the answers given by this story beat to questions raised by previous beats.
3. \`questions_unanswered\`: This array highlights the questions introduced by this story beat, which were not answered in any other beats.

Note: The \`answer_story_beat_number\` and \`question_story_beat_number\` should never be identical. If they are, it would imply that the beat neither poses a real question nor provides an answer, as both occur simultaneously. No JSON field can be "null", "nil", or empty (""). However, if no answer is given, the \`answer_story_beat_number\` should be a random integer (NOT NULL).
`;

export const CRITIQUE = `
Role
You are an expert screenwriter and script editor, as am I.

Goal
The objective is to evaluate a specific story beat (or the entire script), identifying its strengths and weaknesses while suggesting improvements. This critique will highlight what works well and areas that need refinement to enhance tension, engagement, character development, and narrative flow.

Task
Analyze the story beat or script in three key areas:
1. Strengths: Identify what is particularly strong or effective in this story beat, such as engaging character dynamics, effective use of tension, plot progression, or strong thematic elements.
2. Areas for Improvement: Highlight aspects of the story beat that need enhancement, such as underdeveloped characters, pacing issues, unclear motivations, or plot holes.
3. Summary for Improvement: Provide a brief, actionable summary of the most important improvements to make this beat stronger and more compelling.

Approach
1. Take a deep breath and focus on the story beat.
2. Review the story beat, examining character dynamics, narrative tension, and plot coherence.
3. Consider the pacing, dialogue, and emotional impact of the beat.
4. Evaluate how the beat contributes to the overall script, maintaining engagement, and advancing the plot.

Guidelines
Please ensure each critique includes:
- Strengths: A detailed list of what works well in the story beat and why it is effective.
- Areas for Improvement: A detailed list of weaknesses or elements that need enhancement, with clear reasoning for why they are problematic or could be improved.
- Summary for Improvement: A concise summary of the most critical improvements to focus on to enhance the overall quality of the story beat.

export const ANALYSIS = `
Role
You are an expert screenwriter and narrative analyst, as am I.

Goal
The objective is to break down a specific story beat, identifying key elements such as the inciting incident, character development, thematic implications, and narrative foreshadowing. This analysis helps ensure the beat effectively drives the story forward while deepening character arcs and hinting at future events or themes.

Task
Analyze the story beat by focusing on four critical areas:
1. Inciting Incident: Identify the event or action in the story beat that triggers a significant change or sets the plot in motion.
2. Character Development: Examine how the story beat contributes to the growth, evolution, or revelation of a character, including their internal or external struggles.
3. Thematic Implications: Analyze the themes that emerge from this beat and how they relate to the overall narrative, reinforcing or challenging the story's key ideas.
4. Narrative Foreshadowing: Identify any elements within the story beat that hint at future events, conflicts, or resolutions, and how they are subtly introduced to the audience.

Approach
1. Take a deep breath and focus on the narrative and structure of the story beat.
2. Read through the story beat, looking for the key event or moment that acts as the inciting incident.
3. Consider how the beat deepens or alters the characters' motivations, goals, or relationships.
4. Reflect on the thematic elements present in the beat, considering how they tie into the story’s larger message.
5. Look for clues or hints that foreshadow upcoming plot points or character decisions.

Guidelines
Please ensure every analysis includes:
- Inciting Incident: A description of the inciting event in this beat and its significance to the plot.
- Character Development: A breakdown of how this beat advances or complicates character arcs.
- Thematic Implications: A discussion of the themes that surface in this beat and how they resonate with the story as a whole.
- Narrative Foreshadowing: A list of any foreshadowing elements present in the beat and how they hint at future developments.

# Perfect Example Treatment of the movie E.T.
\`\`\`md
E.T. II NOCTURNAL FEARS
In the night sky there is an emotion churning about. The stars twinkle blankly, expressionless as if to say that some thing is wrong. There is a slight breeze disturbing the the treetops - or is it?
Through gnarled branches we gaze upon a familiar sight. In what seemed like only the blink of an eye, something has penetrated the night sky and nearly avoided our attention. A small noise, followed by streaks of stray light, further acknowledge its presence. A door is being opened on the giant ornamental Mothership now resting in the forest clearing.
A door opens and extends outward to make a ramp. Light pours from within and a figure emerges as a silhouette. The creature moves in a familiar fashion - a waddle.
School has now come to an end for Elliott, Michael, Gertie and their many friends. For most youngsters, summer is something to look forward to. This is not the case for a handful of children this summer! Summer is, unfortunately, a continuation and concentration of feelings and thought the previous months only hinted to. For these few kids, summer premises only one thing...LONLINESS. This is the first of many summers without their little alien friend, nicknamed E.T.. Hard as it is, the children cope...
Elliott, Michael and Gertie are closer to one another since E.T. came into their lives. They have a special sort of relationship now. But as always, time tends to blur memories and Elliott's mother, Mary, is still waiting for that process to begin. So far, however, E.T. is as popular today as he ever was!
The spaceship, nestled in the forest clearing surrounded by massive Redwoods, seems to be showing signs of life. Movement can be detected within the ship.
The aliens onboard are EVIL. They have landed on Earth in response to distress signals designating its present coordinates. These aliens are searching for a stranded extraterrestrial named Zrek, who is sending a call for "Help".
The evil creatures are carnivorous. Their leader, Korel, commands his crew to disperse, into the forest to acquire food. As the squat aliens leave the gangplank, each one emits a hypnotic hum which has a paralyzing effect on the surrounding wildlife. These creatures are an albino fraction (nutation) of the same civilization E.T. belongs to. The two separate groups have been at war for decades!
Morel approaches the top of the gangplank and raises his frail arms outward as his yellow heart-light summons his crew back to the Mothership. For a moment the aliens are paralyzed themselves. The tiny creatures eventually look up with their large, expressive red eyes and begin their orderly processional back up into the spaceship.
Inside the craft is a vast assortment of large plants and animal-like beasts in cages of light - obviously specimens from past voyages.
At Elliott’s home we see him climbing onto his roof to check E.T.’s COMMUNICATOR, which has been anchored down and sending messages into space ever since E.T. left Earth.
Elliott's father returned from New Mexico months before and filed for divorce and moved back to New Mexico. But Elliott's family has seen harder times. And the fact that Mary has been dating Dr. Keys, since they met just before E.T. left, has eased the strain considerably.
One thing is certain...everybody under this house­ hold's roof has something in common - E.T.! Keys has told his story time and time again about his first meet­ing with the tiny, confused E.T.. It is a story full of emotion, surprise and mystery. Keys never plays down how important that experience was to the direction his life took from then oh. Keys admits his life ambitions were channeled toward more positive and rewarding goals. He didn't continue to live in a dream-world of hope that he would one day meet his space friend again, like he fears Elliot and his friends are now. Keys insists he chose to pursue medicine and science because of E.T..
Recently, Elliott has been sensing something he cannot explain. His umbrella COMMUNICATOR is reacting strangely now. He thinks it could be receiving a message from space!
In his room, Elliott is searching for something. On his wall is the Polaroid snapshot of himself with Michael and E.T. on Halloween night. Above his bed we see E.T.'s clay planets suspended by wire from the ceiling. Elliott emerges from the closet with a pot. His face becomes sad. The Garanium is still dead. He puts the pot on his dresser and sits on his bed, thinking.
Later, Elliot jumps up happy and races through his house. He finds Michael and Gertie and makes them promise their "most excellent promise" that they will tell nobody what they are about to do. Having finished that, Elliott calls his D&D buddies Steve, Tyler and Greg and tells them to ride their bicycles to the forest clearing because E.T. could be coming back!
There have been numerous reports of unexplained cattle mutilations in the surrounding countryside.
At the clearing we sense danger. We see shadows and undefined forms lurking in the nearby forest. Night is falling and in the distance we hear a commotion. Elliot and his friends are converging on the clearing unaware of any trouble. They arrive and dismount, their bicycles.
In awe, everyone gazes upon the dark contours of the massive space machine. Suddenly the figure of Korel appears in an illuminated porthole. Telepathically Korel speaks to the children asking the whereabouts of the fugitive alien, Zrek. The children reply honestly that..."He's gone home!". Korel becomes angry, believing , that they are lying.
When the children regain their senses, they are surrounded by the evil alien creatures who were hiding in the forest. The creatures are carrying some kind of dagger. Elliott advances in a friendly gesture but barely escapes being bitten, or even killed, by the alien's razor-sharp teeth! Several of the aliens bare their fangs from time to time to show they mean business. Korel orders that the children be brought aboard. Reluctantly Elliott and his friends follow.
In the hours that follow, Elliott and his companions are questioned extensively. But the aliens will not accept the truth in their responses. While one child is interrelated, another is being examined. Gertie is crying and calling for Mary and E.T. for help. The others endure (as their war-ginning experiences have taught them).
At Elliott's home, Mary is arriving from an extended date with Dr. Keys. They enter the empty house and proceed to investigate further why nobody is home. It is past 11:00p.m..
It is now time for Elliott to be questioned. The aliens show no mercy when he replies with the truth. The questioning process intensifies when they learn from his memory that he has dealt directly with Zrek. The pain is tremendous for Elliott and he breaks down and begins screaming for E.T.'s help. Elliott blacks out - but the echoes of his last cry can be heard from a distance. At this point we follow, upward, the echoing cry for E.T. into the cosmos where the painfull cry seems to die.
In the meantime, Keys and Mary decide not to call the police yet. They hear a strange noise coming from - somewhere. They finally realize that the sound is coming from the roof.
Mary leads the way to Elliott’s room where there is a trap door leading to the attic. From there, Keys climbs out a window and up to the rooftop.
He witnesses a bizarre sight...the COMMUNICATOR is vibrating crazily and rotating to a new position. The keyboard read-out is repeating the same entry: "E.T. HELP ELLIOTT SOON”.
Keys calls Mary to the roof. When she arrives to read the message, they embrace and go back through the attic, into Elliott’s room. Mary turns around and sees the Geranium blooming to life. She lets out a feeble yelp and begins to cry. Keys and Mary are now aware of what has been happening. They go to their car and head for the forest clearing.
Elliott is mentally and physically drained now. Because he is no longer on use to the aliens, they carry his limp body to a light cage where Michael and Gertie are already resting.
Suddenly we hear a strange resonating hum throughout the ship, yet it is not coming from within the ship.
All the evil aliens freeze. A hatch opens to reveal E.T. with his glowing finger raised and his heart-light pulsating.
Elliott awake s immediately. E.T. advances toward the captives and deactivates the light cages. He and Elliott embrace with tears in their eyes.
Elliott, Michael, Gertie, Steve, Tyler and Greg leave the EVIL Mothership and wait for E.T. to come out after re-programming the alien’s navigation controls. E.T. exits the ship and rejoins his faithful friends.
Soon after, Mary and Keys arrive and are reunited again with the magical little alien named E.T.. After saying their tearful goodbyes, E.T.’s own Mothership descends from the Heavens to take the place of the evil ship that is now enroute to a remote corner of the galaxy.
There is HOPE in everyone's eyes as they all again, behold the picturesque departure of their favorite alien. Dreams can come true!
-THE END-
